    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <div id="trsection">
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the
            app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages
            known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your
            own page.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco. On twitter you can use the hashtag
            key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By
            clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word
            or phrase.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light blue background. The bird is
            said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the
            sound the bird would make so it makes sense.</p>

    <h2>Cautions, warnings, potential for misuse</h2>
    <div id="trsection4">
        <img class="warning" src="Logos/attention-sign-png--2400.png">
        <p class="sctext">Twitter has several things in place to give us control over our accounts. Their full privacy policy is found online, most easily through your own privacy settings on your account. The main things we have access over are:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Who sees your tweets – are your tweets completely public or locked for only each approved follower?</li>
                <li>If you can be tagged in pictures – if this is ticked as no, then you cannot be attached to an image, however your name can be mentioned in a comment so this is kind of ineffective.
                </li>
                <li>Who can send you messages – much like your tweet privacy, can anyone send you a direct message or is it only your pre-approved followers?
                </li>
                <li>If you can see sensitive media – if Twitter finds any material a sensitive topic, it gets blurred and you are warned before proceeding or have the option to back out.</li>
                <li>lock and muting accounts – To block someone means they cannot view specifics which will be explained further below. You can also mute someone so that they don’t appear in your timeline but you can still follow them, contact them etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                A blocked twitter user can pretty much still see everything that you tweet, favourite, retweet, etc. You, as a blocker, are more effected. The blocked user:
                <br>
                <li>· Is removed from your follower list</li>
                <li>· Will not show up in your timeline, whether it’s their own account tweeting or someone else you follow retweeting them</li>
                <li>· Will not be able to reply or @ you</li>
                <li>· Will not show on your timeline via </li>retweets, favourites etc.
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            What is public on Twitter from your account regardless is:
            <br>
            <li>Your timezone and language</li>
            <li>How old your account is</li>
            <li>When and where you tweet</li>
            <li>Your likes, replies and comment</li>
            <li>Your address book if you upload it</li>
            <li>Your twitter handle (username)</li>
            <li>Your picture and header</li>
            <li>Your name of which you can choose yourself</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            There are also ‘verified users’ for certain users. Initially, this was done based on how many followers someone had but has changed over the years. There’s now a process. Firstly, you must fill out a form. Then you need:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>· Verified phone number and email – for the email, it is said for example if it’s a business to use an email related to the business</li>
                <li>· A bio, header and icon</li>
                <li>· Your birthday
                    A website linked in the correct place (not your bio)</li>
                <li>Your tweets public</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
    <div id="trsection5">
        <p class="sctext">
            Twitter is a great tool for researching and finding general opinions on topics the student can use, twitter also has a large selection of verified organisation such as Nasa that student can access and tweet asking question that can be replied to.

            Announcements
            Twitter could be used by teacher to make quick announcements such as room changes, assignment changes and deadline dates.
