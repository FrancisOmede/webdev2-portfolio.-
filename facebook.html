        <h1>How To Use </h1>
        <p class="htu">
            Facebook is most commonly used by people as a personal news site, where the things posted are about people they know and by themselves. The majority of people interact on a daily basis so when you log onto the app or website you will see status updates and photos from the people you are friends with on Facebook.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="htu">
            On Facebook it’s common for people to have where they went to school/University, and where they are currently working.
            A lot of people stay up to date on the news through facebook, this is done by reading articles online posted by different news broadcasting companies such as RTE, CNN, BCC and more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="htu">
            To keep up to date with people you know and see what they are up to to you can send them a friend request, you do this by just typing in the person’s name in the search bar, and clicking the icon on their profile, saying “Add Friend”.

    <h2>Cautions, warnings, potential for misuse</h2>
    <div id="fbsection4">
        <img class="warning" src="Logos/attention-sign-png--2400.png">
        <p class="sctext">Facebook is a social media platform that allows people to share their opinions on specific topics. At times however the ability to share your own opinion of something is misused either by people with conflicting opinions wanting to start an argument and becoming vicious towards one another or by people purposely trolling people so that they can get a reaction from them so everyone can see it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sctext">Fake accounts are also extremely dangerous. As there is no real verification method to go through when creating a Facebook account, there have been cases where people have made false accounts for malicious purposes. Such as a peadophile luring kids out in public or an account made to mock someone.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
    <div id="fbsection5">
        <p class="sctext">Social Media applications were not specifically designed for educational purposes, however it has
            the potential to further education inside a classroom. Facebook is most appropriate for discussing and sharing world news and major events. The main reason Facebook is used is to connect with friends, family etc. While Facebook is mainly used to connect with people you already know it can also be a great tool for networking. Facebook creates a sense of community amongst its users and this can lead to a widespread of ideas and collaborations.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sctext"> Similar to creating an online community Facebook can be used to strengthen communication. Students and teachers and students and their peers are now able to share and join their work together easier than ever. Students can now communicate with their classmates and teachers about their course content, besides from this they can also arrange times to work on group projects.
            <br>
            Another way Facebook can be used for teaching and educational benefits is the development of computer skills. Students are developing writing and communication skills through self-expressing posts as well as several other skills such as editing and proofreading.
