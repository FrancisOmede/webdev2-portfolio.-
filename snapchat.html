    <h3>Snapchat</h3>
    <div id="scsection">
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="sctext">Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app used globally, created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy,and Reggie Brown,former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sctext">One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the "my eyes only" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space</p>
        <br>
        <p class="sctext">Snapchat has become known for representing a new, mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality objects. As of October 2019, Snapchat has 210 million daily active users</p>

        <h2>Cautions, warnings, potential for misuse</h2>
        <div id="scsection4">
            <img class="warning" src="Logos/attention-sign-png--2400.png">
            <p class="sctext">Age Limits On the Appstore Snapchat is recommended to those 12+ years of age. The age warnings include; “infrequent/mild profanity or crude humour, infrequent/mild sexual content and nudity, infrequent/mild mature/suggestive themes and infrequent/mild alcohol,tobacco or drug use or references.” Misuse.
                <br>
                <br>
                Snapchat is mainly used for texting and sending photos to friends. It can be misused by people by using it for selling explicit images or drugs, or bullying and harassment. Snapchat tries to prevent this but it still happens everyday. It&#39;s not endorsed by Snapchat so that type of content has to be seeked out or promoted through others.
                <br>
                <br>
                Due to this Snapchat has said that they can&#39;t guarantee the app will be a safe space so they ask you to follow the terms of service. If you violate the terms you can be banned from using the app. Privacy and Security Snapchat takes privacy and security very seriously.
                <br>
                <br>
                On their website under the privacy principles they make it clear that they treat the information of its users differently to other companies. “Snapchat’s designed so that people can only see the things you want to share, for as long as you want to share them.” Abuse and Trolling
                <br>
                <br>
                In an interview with ‘Teen Vogue’ they found that “Out of 10 teenagers who talked to Teen Vogue, only one claimed they had not been on the receiving end of harassment on Snapchat.” On snapchat there are many ways people can be bullied or harassed some of which include; screenshotting and posting private photos of someone on your story or sharing them with others privately and by using anonymous messengers available on the platform to bully people. Images
                <br>
                <br>
                There’s options to see the privacy policy and the terms of service within the apps settings. You can also ask questions through the setting menu on privacy and safety concerns. </p>

        <h2>Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
        <div id="fbsection5">
            <p class="sctext">There are many ways that snapchat can be used for educational purposes. Here are
                some examples:
                Q&amp;A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a
                better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be
                able to take in the information given to them easier.
                Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for
                homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may
                not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students this could be
                very useful. It gives that person to person feel when you could be all be in
                completely different locations.
                Snapchat has this tool where stories are taken down after 24 hours which would be
                useful for students who have any questions or need help with something. It is up
                long enough for the teacher to read but also it is automatically taken down after the
                24 hour period giving anonymity and privacy to the student.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="sctext">Stories are also useful for teachers to upload homework, reminders, notes and even
                questions for their students. Stories could be used for students to take part in
                quizzes or even links to useful videos or articles etc.
                Either way the possibilities are near unlimited when it comes to snapchat, it is a very
                fun way to educate and stay connected with your students.
